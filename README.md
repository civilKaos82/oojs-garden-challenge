# OOJS: A Garden with Flowers

## Summary
We're going to build some JavaScript objects:  a garden object with a collection of flowers.  This challenge will be similar to some of the earlier Ruby challenges that we've completed.  Remember the [orange tree challenge][] where we designed an orange tree that had many oranges?  This challenge will be very similar.


### JavaScript Objects
We're going to build objects using two approaches:  through object literal syntax and through a constructor function.  These are two approaches that ultimately do the same thing:  create objects with attributes and behaviors.

***Object literal syntax***.  When we only need one instance of an object, it's convenient to use object literal syntax to create that object.  We "literally" write the object that we want, declaring the object's properties and their values.  The syntax might feel similar to writing a Ruby hash object, but there's no real equivalent for creating objects this way in Ruby.  In Figure 1 we create a person with first and last names and the behavior to combine them into a full name.

```js
var person = {
  firstName: "Kweku",
  lastName: "White",
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
}

person.firstName;
// => "Kweku"
person.fullName();
// => "Kweku White"
```
*Figure 1*. Using object literal syntax to represent a person as a JavaScript object.


***Constructor functions***.  If we find ourselves needing to create multiple instances of the same type of object, we can write a constructor function.  This is similar to how we create objects in Ruby (i.e., defining a class with an initialize method that sets up objects).  Using a constructor function also allows us to share properties and behaviors among objects through the constructor's prototypeâ€”like instance methods declared in a Ruby class that are shared among instances of that class.  

In Figure 2, we use a constructor function to create two person objects with the same attributes and behaviors as the lone person object created in Figure 1.  The `Person()` constructor function sets the attributes that are unique to each instance:  the first and last names.  The full name behavior is shared by the person objects through the `Person.prototype` object.

```js
var Person = function(firstName, lastName) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.lastName = lastName;
}

Person.prototype.fullName = function() {
  return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName
}

var grayson = new Person("Grayson", "Arthur");
grayson.firstName;
// => "Grayson"

var warner  = new Person("Warner", "Constable");
warner.fullName();
// => "Warner Constable"
```

### Jasmine Tests
Similar to our use of RSpec for testing the behaviors of our Ruby objects, we're going to use [Jasmine][] for testing the behaviors of our JavaScript objects.  Fortunately, Jasmine reads a lot like RSpec; a lot of the functions we'll call have the same names: `describe()`, `it()`, `expect()`, etc.

But there are definitely differences as well.  For example, Jasmine provides a different set of matchers. Many Jasmine matchers are similar to RSpec matchers (e.g., `toEqual()`), but some matchers that we're used to using in RSpec are not available in Jasmine.  `let` is gone, too.  If we have shared setup for tests, we need to use `beforeEach()` and/or `beforeAll()`.  And, of course, the code is JavaScript.  We need to remain aware of JavaScript's scoping rules.  And Ruby blocks are replaced with anonymous functions.  When describing an object in RSpec, the actual tests are declared inside a block passed to the `describe` method.  In our Jasmine tests, anonymous functions fulfill the role of these blocks.  When we call the `describe()` function, we pass along an anonymous function containing the actual tests.  Figures 3 and 4 show the same test written in RSpec and Jasmine.

```ruby
describe "a string with my name" do
  let(:my_name) { "Carson Hollands" }
  
  it("is my name") do
  	expect(my_name).to eq "Carson Hollands"
  end
end
```
*Figure 3.* Testing the value of a Ruby string object with RSpec.

```js
describe("a string with my name", function() {
  var myName;
  
  beforeEach(function() {
    myName = "Carson Hollands";  
  });
  
  it("is my name", function() {
    expect(myName).toEqual("Carson Hollands");
  });
});
```

# Objectives

For this challenge, your task is to implement JavaScript code that will make the provided driver code run without errors or output. **You should NOT need to change the driver code to make things work.**

You will be creating BOTH an Object Literal and a Constructor Function, then adding methods to the Constructor Function's prototype during this challenge. If you have no idea what any of the above terms refer to - stop here. Be sure to do the Intro to OOJS reading, then return to this challenge.

**Be sure to use the comments at the top of the `garden.js` file and the driver code to help guide you when deciding what types of objects to create. **

# Useful Notes / Tidbits

- For a successful solution, you'll need both "object literals" and objects created with a "constructor" and "prototype".
- You can work in Sublime Text 2, then cut-and-paste your code into the Chrome JavaScript console for testing. If `node` is installed, you can run your JS source file from the terminal by typing `node garden.js`.
